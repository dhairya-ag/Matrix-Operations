## 🚀 Implemented Programs

### 1️⃣ Wave Traversal of a Matrix
Traverse the matrix in a **zig-zag wave pattern** column-wise.  


---

### 2️⃣ Transpose of a Matrix
Convert rows into columns and columns into rows.  


---

### 3️⃣ Spiral Traversal of a Matrix
Traverse the matrix elements in **spiral order**.  


---

### 4️⃣ Sparse Matrix Representation
Efficient representation when most elements are **zero**, using `(row, col, value)` format.  


---

### 5️⃣ 90° Clockwise Rotation
Rotate the matrix by **90 degrees clockwise**.  

---

### 6️⃣ 90° Anticlockwise Rotation
Rotate the matrix by **90 degrees anticlockwise**.

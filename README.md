# Matrix Operations in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of **Matrix Transpose** and **Wave Traversal** algorithms. Both are important matrix operations commonly asked in interviews and competitive programming.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Matrix Transpose** (row â†’ column conversion)
- **Wave Traversal** (column-wise wave pattern)
- Clean, beginner-friendly Java code
- Works for any `N x M` matrix

---

## ðŸ“– Algorithms

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Matrix Transpose
Given an `N x M` matrix, the transpose is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal.  
Mathematically:  
\[
transpose[i][j] = original[j][i]
\]

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Wave Traversal
Wave traversal prints the elements of a matrix in a **wave-like fashion** (column-wise):

- Even column â†’ top to bottom  
- Odd column â†’ bottom to top
